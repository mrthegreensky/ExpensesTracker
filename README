ExpensesTracker by Andrew Zhong

Tracks claims and expenses.
When a new claim is created, you can add expenses to it. Claims take two dates, a start date and a end date.
Dates of expenses are currently not restricted to the start and end dates of the claim.
You can have empty claim names and empty expense names as well as empty costs for your expenses (defaults to 0).
Your input for costs are restricted to numbers but are not restricted in the number of numbers after a decimal. 
Claims can be submitted but when submitted can not be edited, nor can expenses be edited. However, you can still view expenses.
Claims can be selected by the user to be rejected or accepted, in which when rejected they can make edits to the expenses or claims.
When accepted, no further edits are allowed at which then, the user may choose to email the claim.
Once a claim is accepted, it cannot be deleted or edited.
The delete functionality of a claim or expense is restricted to only when the claim is not submitted, or when rejected.
